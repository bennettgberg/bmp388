Repository for all raspberry pi code for using BMP388 sensors to measure pressure difference and estimate a flow rate.

bmp388.py: functions for reading from and writing to the bmp388 sensors. Most of the code is borrowed from: 
		 https://github.com/getelectronics/PIBits/blob/master/python/bmp388.py
plotP.py: run a test for a certain time, taking pressure and temperature measurements at regular intervals. Or plot the results from one of these tests.
plotHist.py: plot a histogram of the results from a run of plotP.py (to visualize the average, stdev)
labjack_bpg.py: Control and read from the labjack instrument, which fixes a flow rate of gas across it. 
		(Used for finding and testing the relationship between pressure readings and flow rate.)
		(Code mostly borrowed from Peter Meyers (but he borrowed it from somewhere else too...))
fit_meas.py: take the results of the flow rate from the labjack readings and the pressure readings from plotP.py/plotHist.py and fit them to a straight line
		to obtain an approximate relationship between pressure reading and actual flow rate.
plotFlow.py: Take pressure measurements and convert them to a flow rate, displaying a graph of the results in real time.
viewFlow.py: Helper code to plotFlow.py; animates the graph in real time.
		Important note: Make sure to close the window before killing plotFlow.py, or else the viewFlow.py background process will not be killed.
findCorrelation.py: makes scatter plot of some variable vs. difference in pressure between 2 sensors' readings to try to find a correlation between them.
			(I have yet to find any correlation, this pressure difference seems to change randomly.)

labjack_bpg.py requires 2 more repositories to run, but it also requires a labjack(TM) instrument connected to your USB port (I used my laptop, not the raspberry pi).
Other code should be standalone.
